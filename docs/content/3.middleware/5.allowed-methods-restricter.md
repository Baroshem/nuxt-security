## Usage

This middleware is disabled globally by default. You can customize it both globally and per route like following:

```js{}[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({

  // Global
  security: {
    allowedMethodsRestricter: {
      methods: ['GET']
    }
  }

  // Per Route
  routeRules: {
    '/my-secret-route': {
      security: {
        allowedMethodsRestricter: {
          methods: ['GET']
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

You can also disable the middleware globally or per route by setting `allowedMethodsRestricter: false`.

## Options

Rate limiter accepts following configuration options:

```ts
type HTTPMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'DELETE' | 'PATCH' | 'POST' | string;

export type AllowedHTTPMethods = {
  methods: HTTPMethod[] | '*';
  throwError?: boolean;
}
```

### `methods`

- Default: `*`

An array of allowed HTTP methods or `'*'` to allow all methods.

### `throwError`

- Default: `true`

Whether to throw Nuxt Error with appriopriate error code and message. If set to false, it will just return the object with the error that you can handle.
