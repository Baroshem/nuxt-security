The X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies header is used to permit cross-domain requests from Flash and PDF documents. In most cases, these permissions are defined in an XML document called crossdomain.xml found in the root directory of the web page. For situations in which the root directory cannot be specified, however, this header can be used to define a desired meta policy. The X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies header should ideally be set as restrictively as possible.

## Usage

This header is enabled by default but you can change its behavior like following.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Global
  security: {
    headers: {
      xPermittedCrossDomainPolicies: <OPTIONS>,
    },
  },

  // Per route
  routeRules: {
    '/custom-route': {
      headers: {
        'X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies': <OPTIONS>
      },
    }
  }
})
```

You can also disable this header by `xPermittedCrossDomainPolicies: false`.

## Default value

By default, Nuxt Security will set following value for this header.

```http
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
```

## Available values

The `xPermittedCrossDomainPolicies` header can be configured with following values.

```ts
xPermittedCrossDomainPolicies: 'none'
  | 'master-only'
  | 'by-content-type'
  | 'by-ftp-filename'
  | 'all'
  | false;
```

### `none`

Will prevent the browser from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.

### `master-only`

### `by-content-type`

[HTTP/HTTPS only] Only policy files served with Content-Type: text/x-cross-domain-policy are allowed.

### `by-ftp-filename`
