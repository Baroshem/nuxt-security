:ellipsis{right=0px width=75% blur=150px}

Content Security Policy (CSP) helps prevent unwanted content from being injected/loaded into your webpages. This can mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, clickjacking, formjacking, malicious frames, unwanted trackers, and other web client-side attacks.

## Usage

This header is enabled by default but you can change its behavior like following.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Global
  security: {
    headers: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: <OPTIONS>,
    },
  },

  // Per route
  routeRules: {
    '/custom-route': {
      headers: {
        'Content-Security-Policy': <OPTIONS>
      },
    }
  }
})
```

You can also disable this header by `contentSecurityPolicy: false`.

## Default value

By default, Nuxt Security will set following value for this header.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: base-uri 'self'; font-src 'self' https: data:; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; script-src-attr 'none'; style-src 'self' https: 'unsafe-inline'; upgrade-insecure-requests
```

## Available values

The `contentSecurityPolicy` header can be configured with following values.

```ts
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  'child-src'?: CSPSourceValue[];
  'connect-src'?: CSPSourceValue[];
  'default-src'?: CSPSourceValue[];
  'font-src'?: CSPSourceValue[];

## Strict CSP

Nuxt Security helps you increase the security of your site via **strict CSP** support for both SSR and SSG applications.

For further reading about Strict CSP and how to handle specific cases, please consult our [Adanced Section about Strict CSP](/documentation/advanced/strict-csp)

- For SSR applications, Nuxt Security implements strict CSP via nonces. A one-time cryptographically-generated random nonce is generated at runtime by the server for each request of a page.
- For SSG applications, Nuxt Security implements strict CSP via hashes. At static build-time, Nuxt Security computes the SHA hashes of the elements that are allowed to execute on your site.

If you want to enable strict CSP, we recommend that you configure the `contentSecurityPolicy` header as follows:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  security: {
    nonce: true, // Enables HTML nonce support in SSR mode
    ssg: {
      hashScripts: true, // Enables CSP hash support for scripts in SSG mode
      hashStyles: false // Disables CSP hash support for styles in SSG mode (recommended)
    },
    headers: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        'script-src': [
          "'self'",  // Fallback value, will be ignored by most modern browsers (level 3)
          "https:", // Fallback value, will be ignored by most modern browsers (level 3)
          "'unsafe-inline'", // Fallback value, will be ignored by almost any browser (level 2)
          "'strict-dynamic'", // Strict CSP via 'strict-dynamic', supported by most modern browsers (level 3)
          "'nonce-{{nonce}}'" // Enables CSP nonce support for scripts in SSR mode, supported by almost any browser (level 2)
        ],
        'style-src': [
          "'self'", // Enables loading of stylesheets hosted on your own domain
          "https:", // For increased security, replace by the specific hosting domain or file name of your external stylesheets
          "'unsafe-inline'" // Recommended default for most Nuxt apps
        ]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

These default values will enable Strict CSP in the majority of cases.


## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

Nuxt Security provides first-class support of SSR apps via 'strict-dynamic' and nonces.

To enable Strict CSP in SSR mode, you will need to set the `nonce` option and the `"'nonce-{{nonce}}'"` placeholders:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  security: {
    nonce: true, // Enables HTML nonce support in SSR mode
  },
  headers: {
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      'script-src': [
        "'strict-dynamic'", // Modify with your custom CSP sources
        "'nonce-{{nonce}}'" // Enables CSP nonce support for scripts in SSR mode, supported by almost any browser (level 2)
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

- `nonce`: Set this option to `true` to parse all `<script>`, `<link>` and `<style>` tags in your application and add the nonce value to these. The module parses all inline elements as well as all external resources.
- `"'nonce-{{nonce}}'"` placeholder: Include this value in any individual policy that you want to be governed by nonce. 


::alert{type="warning"}
Our default recommendation is to avoid using the `"'nonce-{{nonce}}'"` placeholder on `style-src` policy.
<br>
⚠ This is because Nuxt's mechanism for Client-Side hydration of styles could be blocked by CSP in that case.
<br>
For further discussion and alternatives, please refer to our [Advanced Section on Strict CSP](/documentation/advanced/strict-csp).
::


_Note: Nonce only works for SSR. The `nonce` option and the `"'nonce-{{nonce}}'"` placeholders are ignored when you build your app for SSG via `nuxi generate`._


## Static Site Generation (SSG)

This module is meant to work with SSR apps, but you can also use this module in SSG apps where you will get a Content Security Policy (CSP) support via `<meta http-equiv>` tag.

This will result in following code being added to your static app `<head>` tag:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'">
```

::alert{type="info"}
ℹ Read more about this [here](https://content-security-policy.com/examples/meta/).
::


To enable Strict CSP for SSG apps, you will need to set the `ssg` option:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  security: {
    ssg: {
      hashScripts: true, // Enables CSP hash support for scripts in SSG mode
      hashStyles: false // Disables CSP hash support for styles in SSG mode (recommended)
    },
    headers: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        'script-src': [
          "'strict-dynamic'", // Modify with your custom CSP sources
          // The nonce-{{nonce}} placeholder is not required and will be ignored in SSG mode
        ]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Nuxt Security will generate script hashes and style hashes for you according to the `ssg` option:
- `hashScripts`: Set this option to `true` to parse all inline scripts as well as all external scripts. Nuxt-Security will compute the hashes of inline scripts and find the `integrity` attributes of external scripts, and will add them to your `script-src` policy.
- `hashStyles`: Set this option to `true` to parse all inline styles as well as all external styles. Nuxt-Security will compute the hashes of inline styles and find the `integrity` attributes of external styles, and will add them to your `style-src` policy.

::alert{type="warning"}
Our default recommendation is to avoid setting the `ssg: hashStyles` option to `true`.
<br>
⚠ This is because Nuxt's mechanism for Client-Side hydration of styles could be blocked by CSP in that case.
<br>
For further discussion and alternatives, please refer to our [Advanced Section on CSP](/documentation/advanced/strict-csp).
::

::alert{type="info"}
For SSG apps with `'strict-dynamic'` mode, external scripts will only be allowed to execute if they carry an integrity attribute. 
<br>
Please see our section on Integrity Hashes [below](#integrity-hashes-for-ssg)
::

_Note: Hashes only work for SSG. The `ssg` options are ignored when you build your app for SSR via `nuxi build`._



## Hot reloading during development

If you have enabled `nonce-{{nonce}}` on `style-src`, you will need to disable it in order to allow hot reloading during development.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  security: {
    nonce: true,
    headers: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        'style-src': process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development' ? 
        ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"] :
        ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "nonce-{{nonce}}"]
      }
    }
  }
})
```


## Per-route configuration

The `nonce` value is generated per request and is added to the CSP header. This behaviour can be tweaked on a route level by using the `routeRules` option:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/custom-route': {
      nonce: false    // do not generate nonce for this route (1)
    },
    '/other-route': {
      nonce: true  // generate a new nonce for this route (2)
    }
  }
})
```


## Nonces for SSR

For SSR apps, if you use `'strict-dynamic'` in your `script-src` policy, each of your external scripts will need to be whitelisted by nonce.

Fortunately, Nuxt Security will include the nonce in all your relevant HTML resources by default.

You can easily add your external scripts to your HTML document with the `useHead` composable:

```ts
useHead({
  script: [
    { src: 'https://example.com/script.js' }
    ] 
  }, { 
    mode: 'server' 
    // Set the mode to 'server' if you want to avoid re-loading the script on the client
    // Set the mode to 'client' if you want client-side only loading
    // see: https://github.com/unjs/unhead/issues/136 
  }
)
```

If you are unwilling or unable to use `useHead`, you can also directly insert tags into the DOM via `document.createElement()`:

```vue
<script setup>
onMounted(() => {
  const script = document.createElement('script')
  script.src = 'loader.js'
  document.head.appendChild(script)
})
</script>
```

## Integrity Hashes For SSG

For SSG apps, if you use `'strict-dynamic'` in your `script-src` policy, each of your external scripts will need to carry an [integrity attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).

This is a mandatory requirement of CSP Level 3.

You can easily add integrity values to your scripts with the `useHead` composable:

```ts
useHead({
  script: [
    { 
      src: 'https://example.com/script.js',
      crossorigin: 'anonymous',
      integrity: 'sha384-.....' // Insert the integrity hash here

    }
  ] 
})
```

If you insert scripts manually in your app, you can also include their integrity attribute manually

```html
<script src="https://example.com/script.js" integrity="sha384-....." crossorigin="anonymous" />
```
