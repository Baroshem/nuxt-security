The X-Download-Options HTTP header has only one option: X-Download-Options: noopen. This is for Internet Explorer from version 8 on to instruct the browser not to open a download directly in the browser but instead to provide only the Save option. The user has to first save it and then open it in an application.

When this directive is used, the user can still save and open the file, but this way the malicious code will be prevented from running on our website. Though it will run on the user’s file system.
