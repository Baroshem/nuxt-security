The HTTP Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) response header allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents. COOP will process-isolate your document and potential attackers can't access your global object if they were to open it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks.

This header should be configured with [COEP](crossoriginembedderpolicy)

## Usage

This header is enabled by default but you can change its behavior like following.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Global
  security: {
    headers: {
      crossOriginEmbedderPolicy: <OPTIONS>,
    },
  },

  // Per route
  routeRules: {
    '/custom-route': {
      headers: {
        'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': <OPTIONS>
      },
    }
  }
})
```

You can also disable this header by `crossOriginEmbedderPolicy: false`.

## Default value

By default, Nuxt Security will set following value for this header.

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

## Available values

The `crossOriginEmbedderPolicy` header can be configured with following values.

```ts
crossOriginOpenerPolicy: 'unsafe-none' | 'same-origin-allow-popups' | 'same-origin' | false
```

### `unsafe-none`

This is the default value. Allows the document to be added to its opener's browsing context group unless the opener itself has a COOP of same-origin or same-origin-allow-popups.

### `same-origin-allow-popups`

Retains references to newly opened windows or tabs that either don't set COOP or that opt out of isolation by setting a COOP of unsafe-none.

### `same-origin`

Isolates the browsing context exclusively to same-origin documents. Cross-origin documents are not loaded in the same browsing context.
