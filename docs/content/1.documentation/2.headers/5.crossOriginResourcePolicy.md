Cross-Origin Resource Policy is a policy set by the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy HTTP header that lets web sites and applications opt in to protection against certain requests from other origins (such as those issued with elements like `<script>` and `<img>`), to mitigate speculative side-channel attacks, like Spectre, as well as Cross-Site Script Inclusion attacks. CORP is an additional layer of protection beyond the default same-origin policy. Cross-Origin Resource Policy complements Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB), which is a mechanism to prevent some cross-origin reads by default.

## Usage

This header is enabled by default but you can change its behavior like following.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Global
  security: {
    headers: {
      crossOriginResourcePolicy: <OPTIONS>,
    },
  },

  // Per route
  routeRules: {
    '/custom-route': {
      headers: {
        'Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy': <OPTIONS>
      },
    }
  }
})
```

You can also disable this header by `crossOriginResourcePolicy: false`.

## Default value

By default, Nuxt Security will set following value for this header.

```http
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

## Available values

The `crossOriginResourcePolicy` header can be configured with following values.

```ts
crossOriginResourcePolicy: 'same-site' | 'same-origin' | 'cross-origin' | false;
```

### `same-site`

Only requests from the same Site can read the resource.

::alert{type="warning"}
⚠️ This is less secure than an origin. The algorithm for checking if two origins are same site is defined in the HTML standard and involves checking the registrable domain.
::

### `same-origin`

Only requests from the same origin (i.e. scheme + host + port) can read the resource.

### `cross-origin`

Requests from any origin (both same-site and cross-site) can read the resource. This is useful when COEP is used (see below).
