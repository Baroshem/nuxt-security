The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should be followed and not be changed. The header allows you to avoid MIME type sniffing by saying that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

::alert{type="info"}

## Usage

This header is enabled by default but you can change its behavior like following.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Global
  security: {
    headers: {
      xContentTypeOptions: <OPTIONS>,
    },
  },

  // Per route
  routeRules: {
    '/custom-route': {
      security: {
        headers: {
          xContentTypeOptions: <OPTIONS>,
        },
      },
    }
  }
})
```

You can also disable this header by `xContentTypeOptions: false`.

## Default value

By default, Nuxt Security will set following value for this header.

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

## Available values

The `xContentTypeOptions` header can be configured with following values.

```ts
xContentTypeOptions: 'nosniff' | false
```

### `nosniff`

Blocks a request if the request destination is of type style and the MIME type is not text/css, or of type script and the MIME type is not a JavaScript MIME type.
