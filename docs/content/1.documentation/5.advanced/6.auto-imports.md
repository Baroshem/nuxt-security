## defuReplaceArray

The `defuReplaceArray` utility is provided to help you merge your security rules recursively.

It is a variant of the standard `defu` utility that replaces array contents instead of merging it.


### Replacing array content

With `defuReplaceArray`, array content is merged with replacement:

```ts
const existingArray = ['a', 'b']
const newArray = ['c']
const result = defuReplaceArray(newArray, existingArray)
// ['c']
```

Compare with the standard `defu` approach, which merges arrays with addition:

```ts
const existingArray = ['a', 'b']
const newArray = ['c']
const result = defu(newArray, existingArray)
// ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

### Server import

Nuxt Security auto-imports the `defuReplaceArray` function by way of a server import.

You can use it anywhere in your server routes, plugins, middlewares etc.

You cannot use this function outside of your `/server` folder.
