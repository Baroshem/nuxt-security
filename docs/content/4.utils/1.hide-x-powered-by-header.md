`X-Powered-By` header is used to inform what technology is used in the server side. This is an unnecessary header causing information leakage, so it should be removed from your application.

 Read more about it [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-appropriate-security-headers).

Fortunately, `@nuxtjs/security` module hides this header by default so your application is not leaking this information in the response headers.

## Options

If you prefer not to have this changed, you can always disable this functionality from the module configuration (which is not recommended but possible) like the following:

```js{}[nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/security'],
  security: {
    hidePoweredBy: false
  }
})
```
