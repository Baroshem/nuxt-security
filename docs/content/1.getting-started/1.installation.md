Install `nuxt-security` module:
```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add security
```

That's it! The Nuxt Security module will now register routeRules and middleware to make your application more secure ✨

## Configuration

Add a `security` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```js
security: {
  // Options
}
```

You can find more about configuring `nuxt-security` [here](/getting-started/configuration).
